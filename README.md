# Gradle Wrapper Generator
[![openupm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/com.gilzoide.gradle-wrapper?label=openupm&registry_uri=https://package.openupm.com)](https://openupm.com/packages/com.gilzoide.gradle-wrapper/)

Automatically generate a [Gradle Wrapper (gradlew)](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html)
when exporting Android projects in Unity.

Just choose the desired version in `Gradle Wrapper` Project Settings and voil√†!
The plugin will use the JDK and Gradle configured in Unity for generating the
wrapper, so there's no need to install or configure anything else.

The `Gradle Version` setting gets stored in the
`ProjectSettings/GradleVersion.txt` file.


## Installing
This package is available on the [openupm registry](https://openupm.com/) and can be installed using the [openupm-cli](https://github.com/openupm/openupm-cli):

```
openupm add com.gilzoide.gradle-wrapper
```

Otherwise, you can install via [Unity Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html)
using this repository URL and tag:

```
https://github.com/gilzoide/unity-gradle-wrapper.git#1.1.0
```

Alternatively, add the following into your `Packages/manifest.json` file:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
// ...
    "com.gilzoide.gradle-wrapper": "https://github.com/gilzoide/unity-gradle-wrapper.git#1.0.5",
// ...
  }
}
```


## How to use
1. Open the `Gradle Wrapper` section in Project Settings
2. Write the version of Gradle you want in the `Gradle Version` setting input
   field
3. Mark `Export Project` in the Build Settings window
4. Hit the `Export` button
5. Enjoy üçæ


## Why
If you open an exported project in Android Studio, it will
generate a Gradle Wrapper if none is found in the project.
It will use one of the newest versions of Gradle, which may be incompatible
with the project's build scripts, and may not be able to build.

Also, even though Unity bundles it's own version of Gradle and all others are
not officially supported, sometimes projects need Gradle features that are only
available in newer versions.
In this scenario, every developer would need to download this specific version
and configure Unity to use it.
On top of that, when dealing with multiple projects, chances are not all of
them need the same version of Gradle.

With `gradlew`, all you need to do is run it, either from Android Studio or
from the console - the wrapper will take care of downloading and running the
right version.

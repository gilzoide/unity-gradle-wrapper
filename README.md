# Gradle Wrapper Generator
Automatically generate a Gradle Wrapper (gradlew) when exporting Android
projects in Unity.

Just choose the desired version in `Gradle Wrapper` Project Settings and that's
it!
The plugin will use the Java and Gradle configured in Unity for generating the
wrapper, so there's no need to configure anything else.
